# Title: Coding Challenges in Java
### These are coding challenges that I found online and I coded the solution for them in Java. Check them out in the Coding Challenges folder. 

## My Objective:
Is to help those who are getting started with coding or preparing for their coding interview. Take a look at how I code it and understand each step of the code.

## How to run the code:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/skytruong90/Coding_Challenges-Java.git
2. The main codes for all 3 challenges are inside a folder called Coding Challenges.
3. Then run the code with any Java IDE of your choice.

## Beginner Challenge:
The prompt for this one is in the "Beginner_Challege" pdf folder. Just open that one and you will see the prompt.

## Intermediate Challenge:
Write a function that will take a given string and reverse the order of the words, but with a string containing punctuation, output the reverse order of the words, but keep the punctuation in the same space.

## Expert Challenge:
Given an array of strings, output a binary search tree made up of the strings in an
understandable format.

The properties of a binary search tree
1. All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
2. All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
3. Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties
Hint: The root is the middle element
You can assume the input will always be a string containing letters and punctuation separated by a single space.

## What I have learned: 
1. How to think and analyze the question.
2. Using what I know and pick a program that I feel comfort working with.
3. The difference between harder questions and easier questions is the time in preparing how to code it and how to structure the code.
